A fast and lightweight Python interface for interacting with Steam. Largely inspired by [Valve Python's Steam package](https://github.com/ValvePython/steam) and [the fork by Solstice Game Studios](https://github.com/solsticegamestudios/steam), this library introduces various tweaks to modernize and improve the structure, including complete typing support and modern dependencies. Some logic is also taken from [SteamRE's SteamKit](https://github.com/SteamRE/SteamKit).

> [!IMPORTANT]

> `steam-python` is currently under heavy development and is not yet ready for public use.

## Installation

```bash
pip install steam-python # Coming soon
```

or

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Steam-Style/steam-python
```

## Usage

To interact with Steam you must first connect to a Connection Manager Server and then log in.

```python
import asyncio
from steam.client import SteamClient

async def main():
    client = SteamClient()

    try:
        # Connect to Steam
        await client.connect()

        # Login anonymously
        await client.anonymous_login()

        # ...

    finally:
        # Disconnect
        await client.disconnect()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Development

This project uses uv for Python dependency management.

1. Prerequisites

   Install `uv` if you haven't already.

   ```bash
   # macOS/Linux
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

   # Windows
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
   ```

2. Setup the project:

   Clone the repository and sync the dependencies. uv will automatically download the correct Python version and create a virtual environment for you:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Steam-Style/steam-python.git
   cd steam-python
   uv sync --all-groups
   ```
